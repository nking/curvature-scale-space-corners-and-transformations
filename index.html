      <p>A few keypoint detectors, feature matchers, and transformation solvers
      are present with other computer vision methods.</p>

<p>The project is still in progress, and what is here has been mildly tested.</p>

<p>Highlights of results so far are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Finding an object in a segmented image by shape alone (ShapeFinder2.java)
             has the true solution in the top matches, but not necessarily the top match,
             and is more computationally expensive than other methods listed.
        </li>
        <li>
             Stereo image matching can be done quickly with ORB keypoints and epipolar transformations,
             and RANSAC outlier remover.
        </li>
        <li>
             An improved Canny Edges Filter can be made for color images by combining the greyscale
             Canny edges with the same made with the "C" image of the LCH colorspace.
        </li>
        <li>
            MSER (Maximally Stable Extremal Regions) are a very fast algorithm that can be used
            where level sets are needed.  Using MSER on greyscale and on the "H" image of
            LCH color space can find potential objects.  
            I combined the Canny color edges with the boundaries of MSER regions to create
            edges that are complete contours (== segmentation).
            The current version has some color filter rules that are potentially fragile,
            but the results look promising and can be sped up.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finding an object in another image in which it has changed location, lighting,
            and pose is not easy, but can be done with MSER and HOGs.
            The current version needs improvements.
        </li>
        <li>
            NOTE the MSER is sensitive to resolution and the classes have been adapted to
            expect input being images of sizes near 256 X 256.
        </li>
    </ul>
