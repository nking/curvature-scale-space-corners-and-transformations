Project is still in progress and what is present is not fully tested
yet.  

Instructions for use of the command line executables will be here
when one of the components being improved is finished.

The project requires java 7 or later to run and requires ant
to build.

The java 7 restriction is due to inclusion of the class ThreadLocalRandom
