Project is still in progress and what is present is not fully tested
yet.  

The project requires java 7 or later to run and requires ant
to build.

The java 7 and above restriction is due to inclusion of the class ThreadLocalRandom

some snapshots (images) from tests are available in the directory doc as pdf files
