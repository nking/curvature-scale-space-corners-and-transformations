(1) reading bishop 2006
    and looking at
    http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/
    and tensorflow
    -- Conditional Random Fields

(2) read the remote s ensing paper

-- revisit the two-point correlation project to make improvements:
    -- use a disjoint forest in assigning points to clusters.
       (see ConnectedPointsFinder.java)
    -- consider kernel smoothing on the distance transform results
       before histograms (replace gaussian kernel w/ binomial approx)
    -- refine density calculation separate logic for the 2 cases of 
       having background points and not

-- consider making a greyscale MSEREdges

-- when return to improving the segmentation, run MSEREdges on
     the berkeley benchmark data

-- consider implementing a affine transformation class

-- consider implementing a 3-view transformation solver
   ...trifocal tensor

-- finish the new HOGs comparison method

-- interesting:
   solving the transformations between 2 images
   when have most the camera matrix, except focal length.

   http://www.vis.uky.edu/~stewe/publications/stewenius_05_cvpr_focal.pdf

   for Structure in Motion, camera information is needed and 5 points of
      correspondence.
   When camera infor is not available, epipolar geometry w/ 7 points of
      correspondence is used, but is not as stable.

-- geohashing and bag of words, etc

-- consider implementing Paris and Durand 2007
     -- uses kruskal's mst for merging os is a fast NlogN

-- consider implementing one day, compressed histogram of grdients:
http://web.stanford.edu/~bgirod/pdfs/Chandrasekhar_CVPR2009.pdf

-- low priority: improve the auxillary methods in the partial shape matchers
    to calculate cost when given correspondence.

-- consider implementing multi-level buckets

-- consider implementing Tarjans latest paper (bipartite matching)

-- consider implementing vanishing lines based upon MSER ellipses

-- consider making a version of normalized cuts that uses the spatial location
    of points too (lkeeping labeled regions contiguous)

-- consider implementing a mean shift algorithm

-- fix the ransac iterator estimate that has a limit of
    1790

-- read more on "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, or SLAM"
     
-- consider following the implementation of disparity maps for stereo images
   and 3d modelling.  see notes in the docs directory.
   -- see http://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/code/

-- test for degenerate camera conditions:
   -- parallel camera motion w/o rotation 
-- test for degenerate scene structure configurations
   -- all points lying on a plane or nearly lying on a plane (?)
-- test for point sets containing noise

-- no priority:
   for jni bindings of the c++ dlib library, would like to automate
    the steps of compile, outlined by the MITIE project.
    dependencies (but for automated platform independence):
      -- swig:
         swig is platform specific and depends upon another platform 
           specific library called PCRE (needed to make pearl bindings).
         to automate the installation if needed and then the use of swig
            to compiJle, a possibility is the use of 2 maven2 plugins:
               -- freehep-swig-plugin 
               -- freehep-nar-plugin 
            the swig plugin requires some additional configuration for
            the download and there is only a small amount of documentation 
            on that.
            -- missing is the information that PCRE needs to be downloaded
               also so that would need to be added to the configuration
               if possible.
            A caveat to this is that these numerous steps to a mvn target
              checking for swig and dependencies and installing them with
              nar when needed would have to be tested for all platforms.
      -- nar:
            writing the nar commands to use swig and cmake would have to
            include the platform specific details present in the
            MITIE README.md file, espec for windows.
            this builds archive files so would be an offline step to
            provide os specific dependencies (which can do if convert 
            project to maven build system)
     cannot easily test on all platforms at this time, so will leave this
     as a todo target for the interesting details, but essentially no
     expected priority.
