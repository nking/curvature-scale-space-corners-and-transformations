-- consider changing over some of the matrix math to use jblas
   (example is in unit tests)

(1) reading bishop 2006
   and looking at
    http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/
(2) read the remote sensing paper

-- consider improving the histograms in external project used by
    this one, two-point=correlation

-- consider making a greyscale MSEREdges

-- consider implementing a affine transformation class

-- consider implementing a 3-view transformation solver
   ...trifocal tensor

-- finish the new HOGs comparison method

-- interesting:
   solving the transformations between 2 images
   when have most the camera matrix, except focal length.

   for Structure in Motion, camera information is needed and 5 points of
      correspondence.
   When camera infor is not available, epipolar geometry w/ 7 points of
      correspondence is used, but is not as stable.

-- geohashing and bag of words, etc

-- consider implementing Paris and Durand 2007
     -- uses kruskal's mst for merging os is a fast NlogN

-- consider implementing one day, compressed histogram of grdients:
http://web.stanford.edu/~bgirod/pdfs/Chandrasekhar_CVPR2009.pdf

-- low priority: improve the auxillary methods in the partial shape matchers
    to calculate cost given correspondence.

-- consider implementing multi-level buckets

-- consider implementing Tarjans latest paper (bipartite matching)

-- consider implementing the vanishing lines based upon MSER ellipses

-- consider making a version of normalized cuts that uses the spatial location
    of points too (a lkeeping labeled regions contiguous)

-- consider implementing a mean shift algorithm

-- Conditional Random Fields

-- fix the ransac iterator estimate that has a limit of
    1790

-- read more on "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, or SLAM"
     
-- consider following the implementation of disparity maps for stereo images
   and 3d modelling.  see notes in the docs directory.
   -- see http://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/code/

-- test for degenerate camera conditions:
   -- parallel camera motion w/o rotation 
-- test for degenerate scene structure configurations
   -- all points lying on a plane or nearly lying on a plane (?)
-- test for point sets containing noise

-- more reading on 3d reconstruction
