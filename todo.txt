-- consider changing over some of the matrix math to use jblas
   (example is in unit tests).  jblas is already included in project,
   but accessed mostly via MTJ.

-- for global search/optimization methods, consider importing
      https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java
     -- use the simulted annealing and/or other global
        optimization for the polynomial curve fitting
     would like to consider importing best global optimization
     (? random search, a genetic algorithm, simulated annealing,
      or particle swarm)
    -- consider the "clever algorithms" 

(1) reading bishop 2006
    and looking at
    http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/
    and tensorflow
    -- Conditional Random Fields


(2) read the remote sensing paper

-- consider making a greyscale MSEREdges

-- when return t improving the segmentation, run MSEREdges on
     the berkeley benchmark data


-- consider implementing a affine transformation class

-- consider implementing a 3-view transformation solver
   ...trifocal tensor

-- finish the new HOGs comparison method

-- interesting:
   solving the transformations between 2 images
   when have most the camera matrix, except focal length.

   http://www.vis.uky.edu/~stewe/publications/stewenius_05_cvpr_focal.pdf

   for Structure in Motion, camera information is needed and 5 points of
      correspondence.
   When camera infor is not available, epipolar geometry w/ 7 points of
      correspondence is used, but is not as stable.

-- no priority:
   for jni bindings of the c++ dlib library, would like to automate
    the steps of compile, outlined by the MITIE project.
    dependencies:
      -- swig:
         swig is platform specific and depends upon another platform 
           specific library called PCRE (needed to make pearl bindings)
         to automate the installation if needed and then the use of swig
            to compile,
            a possibility is the use of 2 maven2 plugins:
               -- freehep-swig-plugin 
               -- freehep-nar-plugin 
            the swig plugin requires some additional configuration for
            the download and there is a small amount of documentation 
            on that.
            -- missing is the information that PCRE needs to be downloaded
               also so that would need to be added to the configuration
               if possible.
            A caveat to this is that these numerous steps to a mvn target
              checking for swig and dependencies and installing them with
              nar when needed would have to be tested for all platforms.
      -- nar:
            writing the nar commands to use swig and cmake would have to
            include the platform specific details present in the
            MITIE README.md file, espec for windows.
            this builds archive files so would be an offline step to
            provide os specific dependencies (which can do if convert 
            project to maven build system)
     cannot easily test on all platforms at this time, so will leave this
     as a todo target for the interesting details, but essentially no
     expected priority.
