-- make an executable jar for the two-point correlation code and a link to
   it from the wiki

-- make the downhill simplex improvements (already present in the curvature project)
   http://nking.github.io/curvature-scale-space-corners-and-transformations/

-- consider whether can make a faster but still accurate version (espec for very large N) that
   fits a polynomial peak to the GEV peak faster than fits to a GEV curve.
   simplest peak finding is not enough for robust results.

-- for point sets in which the number of points in the range of data is large and
   a large percentage of the area of that range, consider using the distance transform
   from my curvature project (it's the Meijster et al algorithm which uses dynamic programming
   and Voronoi regions to make a sq distance map to nearest boundaries within
   a linear runtime where N is the number of pixels (data range area) rather than the number of points).  
   The resulting distribution of distances would have to
   be handled differently since they aren't the value for unique voids between points...
   the distances data between every pair is now from 1 to square(pair distance) -1,
   so the distribution is no longer a GEV though the maxima alone would be...
   need to think about how to acurately find the background density from it...

   -- separate classes for the distance transform version and an executable jar using just them.
   -- a jar for just the distance transform version to use in other projects
   -- possibly, helper classes to reduce sets larger than 5000 x 5000 in pixels
   -- possibly, helper classes to help with numerical resolution to scale floats to integers
      with an integer difference representing the desired numerical resolution
   -- add documentation adn advice on how to treat the data before use here in order
      to get comparable similarity or affinity results.
      for example, for data with desired expontial similarity functions,
      would want to apply the exponential operations to the data before use here and
      scale the data for numerical resolution such that an integer holds the 
      significant difference between points.
          exp(a - b) is exp(a)/exp(b)
