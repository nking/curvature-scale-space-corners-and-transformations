-- make an executable jar for the two-point correlation code and a link to
   it from the wiki

-- make the downhill simplex improvements (already present in the curvature project)

-- consider whether can make a faster but still accurate version (espec for very large N) that
   fits a polynomial peak to the GEV peak faster than fits to a GEV curve.
   simplest peak finding is not enough for robust results.
