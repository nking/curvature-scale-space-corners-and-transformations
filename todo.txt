-- consider changing over some of the matrix math to use jblas
   (example is in unit tests).  jblas is already included in project,
   but accessed mostly via MTJ.

-- while reading bishop 2006, a goal is to add specific methods
   that are alternatives to what s present, for example, in curve fitting.
   - present are regression w/ OLS, ThielSen for example
     and would like to add local optimization of polynomial fitting w/ LBFGS,
     and curve fitting w/ regularization and loss function using "elastic net".
     -- dlib is a C++ library w/ both of those.
        can either:
        -- extract the needed classes and port to java making a small lightweight
           inclusion.
           pros: small and fast
           cons: a brief look at the code suggests porting the needed SVM might
                 take awhile.
        -- OR can use CMake and SWIG to make jni bindings for dlib.
           (or include MITIE and build it)
           pros: other classes in dlib are useful for exploration of more of Bishop2006
                 material.  same could be said for the larger MITIE project.
           cons: requires for build, installation of CMake and SWIG (and PCRE)
                 that currently requires more than one step for the user.
                 - to make it seamless for user, could change builds to
                   maven and use a CMake plugin and a dependency on SWIG
                   which presumably has a maven plugin.
                   NOTE: details to the later are at the end of this file.
                   the reader given a few installation instructions is 
                   more fesible at this time.

-- NOTE that the polynomial unit test for dlib LBFGS
      -- passes for dlib search strategy-5, but not 20,
      so need to consider adding another search strategy
      to LBFGS.java here or replacing it with use of dlib
      as outlined above.

-- would like an elasticnet implementation 
   -- see outline above... dlib has this

-- for global search/optimization methods, consider importing
      https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java
     -- use the simulted annealing and/or other global
        optimization for the polynomial curve fitting
     would like to consider importing best global optimization
     (? random search, a genetic algorithm, simulated annealing,
      or particle swarm)
    -- consider the "clever algorithms" 

(1) reading bishop 2006
    and looking at
    http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/
    and tensorflow
    -- Conditional Random Fields


(2) read the remote sensing paper

-- consider making a greyscale MSEREdges

-- when return t improving the segmentation, run MSEREdges on
     the berkeley benchmark data


-- consider implementing a affine transformation class

-- consider implementing a 3-view transformation solver
   ...trifocal tensor

-- finish the new HOGs comparison method

-- interesting:
   solving the transformations between 2 images
   when have most the camera matrix, except focal length.

   http://www.vis.uky.edu/~stewe/publications/stewenius_05_cvpr_focal.pdf

   for Structure in Motion, camera information is needed and 5 points of
      correspondence.
   When camera infor is not available, epipolar geometry w/ 7 points of
      correspondence is used, but is not as stable.

-- no priority:
   for jni bindings of the c++ dlib library, would like to automate
    the steps of compile, outlined by the MITIE project.
    dependencies:
      -- swig:
         swig is platform specific and depends upon another platform 
           specific library called PCRE (needed to make pearl bindings)
         to automate the installation if needed and then the use of swig
            to compile,
            a possibility is the use of 2 maven2 plugins:
               -- freehep-swig-plugin 
               -- freehep-nar-plugin 
            the swig plugin requires some additional configuration for
            the download and there is a small amount of documentation 
            on that.
            -- missing is the information that PCRE needs to be downloaded
               also so that would need to be added to the configuration
               if possible.
            A caveat to this is that these numerous steps to a mvn target
              checking for swig and dependencies and installing them with
              nar when needed would have to be tested for all platforms.
      -- nar:
            writing the nar commands to use swig and cmake would have to
            include the platform specific details present in the
            MITIE README.md file, espec for windows.
            this builds archive files so would be an offline step to
            provide os specific dependencies (which can do if convert 
            project to maven build system)
     cannot easily test on all platforms at this time, so will leave this
     as a todo target for the interesting details, but essentially no
     expected priority.
