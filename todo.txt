-- crit density solver needs to solve in dt space between clusters

   For datasets in which the clusters are much further away from one 
             another than the largest value in the frequency map,
             those furthest value points should be collected.
             We want the representative distances between those furthest value
             points (they uniquely span the distances between the clusters, or
             at least the closest among them as groups does).
             Need to group those furthest value points by the assoc radius 
             derived so far:
                 clustered within the distance 2./(2.5/math.sqrt(maxValue)).
             Then the distances between those largest value point groups should 
             be calculated (their coords are the centroids of the groups. so
             they are sometimes the centers of the cluster they surround).
             Then the final critical density would be 1./maxValueSepDistance.
