format {*ascii|binary} {*cr|map}
	date <date string>
	image <int>	# image ID number
	user <int>	# user ID number
	width <int>	# width of image
	height <int>	# height of image
	segments <int>	# number of segments
	gray {*0|1}	# image presented in grayscale?
	invert {*0|1}	# image presented with pixel values inverted?
	flipflop {*0|1}	# image presented upside-down and backwards?

<s> <r> <c1> <c2>

All values start counting at 0.  <s> is the segment number; <r> is the
row; <c1> and <c2> are column numbers.  The line means that columns
[<c1>..<c2>] of row <r> belong to segment <s>.  Lines of this sort can
appear in any order, and can be reordered without harm.  The only
restriction is that each pixel must be named exactly once.
