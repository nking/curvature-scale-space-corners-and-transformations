Datasets from the 2003 datasets of
http://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/scenes2003/

Note: These are already rectified.

They are taken from equally-spaced viewpoints along the x-axis from left to right. 
The images are rectified so that all image motion is purely horizontal. 
To test a two-view stereo algorithm, the two reference views 
im2 (left) and im6 (right) should be used. Ground-truth disparites with 
quarter-pixel accuracy are provided for these two views. 
Disparities are encoded using a scale factor 4 for gray levels 1 .. 255, 
while gray level 0 means "unknown disparity".  Therefore, the encoded 
disparity range is 0.25 .. 63.75 pixels.
