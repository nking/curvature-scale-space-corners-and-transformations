A subset of the Berkeley segmentation images are
present to help evaluate segmentation algorithms.
The information below includes licensing information
and paper references.

The images and files of human interaction contours
are from 
    http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/code/segbench.tar.gz

The paper referenced there is:
   "Contour Detection and Hierarchical Image Segmentation"
    by Arbela ÃÅez and Maire

Also on the Berkeley segmentation web site is this request
regarding data.

"You are free to download a portion of the dataset for non-commercial research and educational purposes.  In exchange, we request only that you make available to us the results of running your segmentation or boundary detection algorithm on the test set as described below.  Work based on the dataset should cite our ICCV 2001 paper:
