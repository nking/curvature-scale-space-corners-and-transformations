a summary of the feature matchers before making an agile story and tasks
from these.

each of the matchers has these steps:

(1) create points of interest and any associated data products
    such as blobs or blob perimeters.

    corner types:
      -- segmentation + blob extraction + perimeter extraction
         + corners of perimeters + optional addition of corners
         by bisecting existing corners along their perimeters.
      -- canny edges + corners
      -- 2nd derivatives in the image for some number limit.

    filters available for above corners, depending upon corner type:
        -- filter for those w/o close 2nd best.
        -- filter to remove those w/ eigenvalues suggesting not easy 
           to localize (due to being on an edge, for example).  

(2) optionally, create lists from the corners before homology based matching.
    -- can associate the corners with blobs, making groups of corners.
       (this is the default w/ blob based corners, and should
       be an option for all others, but requires making the blobs
       using segmentation as a separate step).
    -- can make a list of the top k matches for each image1 corner
       to image 2 corners using:
       -- cosine similarity to filter out those w/ sim < 0.95
          -- the top k matches by SSD are kept
          -- * could implement top k by similarity value instead.
    
(3) the homology solvers take the point lists and solve for transformations
    and then evaluate for best transformations.
