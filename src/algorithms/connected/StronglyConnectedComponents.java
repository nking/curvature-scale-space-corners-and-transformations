/**
 * A strongly connected (a.k.a. diconnected) graph is one in which every vertex 
 * is reachable from every other vertex.
 * The strongly connected components of an arbitrary directed graph form a 
 * partition into subgraphs that are themselves strongly connected.
 * 
 * It is possible to test the strong connectivity of a graph, or to find 
 * its strongly connected components, in linear time (that is, Î˜(V+E)).
 * 
 * A directed graph is called strongly connected if there is a path in each 
 * direction between each pair of vertices of the graph. That is, a path exists 
 * from the first vertex in the pair to the second, and another path exists 
 * from the second vertex to the first. 
 * 
 * A pair of vertices u and v in a directed graph G that may not itself be 
 * strongly connected, are said to be strongly connected to each other if there 
 * is a path in each direction between them.
 * 
 * Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm traverses the graph once, 
 * using a stack in which the vertices are not remvoed unless found to be
 * strongly connected.
 * 
 * Runtime complexity is O(|E| + |V|) (average?), and the worse case runtime
 * complexity is one in which the graph is completely connected, strongly,
 * O(|V|*(2 + 5w)) where w is the word size in bits.
