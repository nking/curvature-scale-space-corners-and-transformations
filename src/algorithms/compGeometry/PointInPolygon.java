 * counts the number of times a ray intersects the edges of the polygon starting
 * from the point and going ANY fixed direction. This algorithm is sometimes
 * also known as the crossing number algorithm or the even-odd rule algorithm.
 * The implementation here is different, and includes logic for testing whether
 * the point is in the polygon lines too.
 * 
 * Many edits were made to handle cases such as point being same as a corner of
 * the polygon or being on the polygon line.
