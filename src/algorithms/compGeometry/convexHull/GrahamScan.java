/**
 * Solves the Convex Hull problem w/ a stack S of candidate points.
 *
 * Given a set of Q points returns the vertices of the ConvexHull(Q) in counterclockwise
 * order.   a convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that will include all points in Q.
 *
 * Graham's Scan runs in O(n lg n).
 *   (in contrast to Jarvis's March which runs in O(nh) where h is the number of
 *   vertices in the convex hull.)
 * Will adjust this after estimates...
 *
 * Both use a technique called 'rotational sweep' to process vertices in the order
 * of the polar angles they form with a reference vertex.
 *
 * constructed from pseudo-code in Cormen et al. "Introduction to Algorithms
