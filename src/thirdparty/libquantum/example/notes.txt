present are the output of printing the register of bitstrings (states)

The successive stages of Shor's algorithm for arguments 15, 8 
are seen in t?.txt

NOTE also that the results are for previous version which began
with a width greater than 1, so has more nodes.
The current implementation uses fewer nodes.

Note that the format of the register print out for each
node being a line in the file:

    node.amplitude.real node.amplitude.imag'i' | state > ampl^2 (state bitstring)
