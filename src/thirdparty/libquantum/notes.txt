from the libquantum documentation:
     Density operator formalism
When dealing with systems with many qubits, it is often inconvenient 
to use state vectors to describe the system as the required computational 
power grows exponentially. In the case of non-interacting subsystems the 
problem can be solved by using the density operator formalism. 
In this formalism the quantum state $\rho$ is represented by a statistical 
mixture of state vectors where 

\begin{displaymath}\rho = 
    \sum_i p_i \vert\psi_i\rangle \hspace{-0.092cm} \langle\psi_i\vert \; . \end{displaymath}

Here $p_i$ denotes the probability of finding the system in the state $\psi_i$ 
    [Breuer, 2002].
