Project Description:
--------------------
The project, GEVSimilarity, is a small side project to examine whether or
not a smaller range of parameters can be used to generate curves that
represent the whole range of possible curves.   


NOTE:  the project is in progress and the build has not yet been
    completely adjusted for other operating systems (specifically, 
    setting the path for the boost libraries might need to be improved).  
    A list for known OS builds will be here when tests on one system are complete.


------------
Required
------------
(1) Java 7 or later
(2) maven2
(3) C++
(4) autotools (autoconf, automake)


-----------
Building
-----------
(1) The Java portion:

    (a) mvn clean compile

    (b) mvn test -Dtest=algorithms.curves.GEVSimilarityToolTest

    This creates a large log file containing statements about
    the similar and unique curves.  The log file is in
    target/sure-fire-reports/algorithms.curves.GEVSimilarityToolTest-output.txt

    It also creates transparent images in target/ as png files
    that can be viewed as layers together with the file to see the
    range of parameters.

    It also creates the curves for the similar spectra as an html file
    for ease of seeing the similar curves and their parameter dependent
    evolution.

(2) The C++ portion:

    (a) aclocal
        generates m4 files and sub-directory

    (b) autoconf
        generates configure from configure.ac

    (c) automake -a -c
        to generate Makefile.in

    (d) ./configure --with-boostinc=<location of boost tr1 subdirectory in c++ headers>
        generates the Makefile
            example:  
                ./configure --with-boostinc=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1/tr1

    (e) make
        compiles the sources into objects, links, and creates target executables

    Then to run the code, 
        make runtest


    This reads the logfile target/sure-fire-reports/algorithms.curves.GEVSimilarityToolTest-output.txt
    
    The code calculates the smallest set of parameters (k, sigma, and mu) which can represent
    the entire range of curves.

    The results are printed to 
        target/parameters/
