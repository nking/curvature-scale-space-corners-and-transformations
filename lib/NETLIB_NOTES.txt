netlib has many dependencies.
so to import them all, built a temporary
maven2 project and added this dependency to the pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.fommil.netlib</groupId>
     <artifactId>all</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.2</version>
    <type>pom</type>
</dependency>

then installed the project and listed the dependencies:
    mvn  dependency:tree -Dmdep.pathSeparator=',' -Dmdep.prefix='.' -Dmdep.fileSeparator='/

then made a script to copy out the listed jar files from the $M2_HOME directory,
unjar them into a temporary directory,
and jar them into one large jar file called netlib-java-1.1.2.jar 

there is probably a plugin that will do all of this
