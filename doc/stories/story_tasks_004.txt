Story: Reduce memory use of Image and GreyscaleImage
 
    summary: caching segmentation images in the scale calculator
      is consuming alot of memory, so need to reduce the space
      complexity.

Task 1:  Refactor Image and GreyscaleImage and associated classes
      
    details:  

      The Image.java and GreyscaleImage.java can easily be changed
      to use 4 times less memory by storing 4 bytes in each
      space in their integer arrays.
      Code accessing the arrays has to be updated to use the
      image methods instead of directly accessing the arrays now
      (for example, MiscMath methods for min and max finding).
      For 64 bit systems, the space that an int occupies on the
      stack is word size, so a long[] should be used and in that
      case the savings is a factor of 8 per image array (= 24 for 
      color image).

    time estimate: min 2 days, max 5 days
  
    amount of time used:
        1 day so far
