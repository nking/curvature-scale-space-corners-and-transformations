"A factorization based algorithm for multi-image projective structure and motion"
   by Sturm and Triggs, 2011

The complete algorithm is composed of the following steps.
1. Normalize the image coordinates, by applying transformations T_i
   transformed points are centered at the origin and the mean distance from the origin is sqrt(2)
   following Har95
2. Estimate the fundamental matrices and epipoles with the method of [Har95].
3. Determine the scale factors lambda_ip using equation (3)􏰑
     Solving the vector equation (2) in least squares for lambda_ip􏰑in terms of lambda_jp
     gives              (e_ij Ʌ q_ip) dot (F_ij * q_jp)
            lambda_ip = -------------------------------
                               ||e_ij Ʌ q_ip||^2
4. Build the rescaled measurement matrix W .
5. Balance W by column-wise and triplet-of-rows-wise scalar multiplications
       (see Section 3.2)
6. Compute the SVD of the balanced matrix W .
7. From the SVD, recover projective motion and shape.
8. Adapt projective motion, to account for the normalization transformations
