/**
 * finds the pair of points most distant from one another a.k.a. the
 * furthest pair problem.
 * one can imagine a rough estimate by fitting an ellipse around the given points
 * and determining the major axis of the points.
 * even more precisely, one can fit a convex hull around the points and
 * determine which pair of points has the largest distance between them.
 * Note that the convex hull returns points ordered in a counter-clockwise manner
 * so is suitable for ordered traversal already.
 * 
 * One can speculate that a &quot;rotating calipers&quot; approach could reduce the
 * further search by half, that is, only traversing half of the convex hull points,
 * but random input testing shows that the possibly very uneven distribution
 * of points on the convex hull should all be visited.  The savings by roughly
 * half arises by terminating each leading points' search for distance pair
 * as soon as the distances start to decrease.
 * 
 * In this algorithm, since whole number are given as input, the convex hull
 * uses an internal sorting by polar angles rounded to integers between 0
 * and 359, inclusive, making the convex hull algorithm runtime complexity
 * O(N) where N is the number of x, y points given to this class.
 * 
 * The largest distance between a pair then proceeds to use the number of 
 * points on the convex hull, n_H.  The runtime complexity of the largest
 * distance algorithm is O(n_h^2).
 * 
 * We can speculate about the size of the hull from information in Cormen
 * et al. Introduction to Algorithms, Exercise 33-5
 * for sparse-hulled distributions of a unit-radius disk, a convex polygon with k sides,
 * and a 2-D normal distribution respectively as n^(1/3), log_2(n), sqrt(log_2(n)).
 * 
 * Then, assuming that N &gt; n_h^2, this algorithm's total runtime complexity is
 * O(N).

    /**
     * find the largest distance between the given pairs of points.
     * The runtime complexity is &lt;em&gt;O(N*log_2(N))&lt;/em&gt;, 
     * worse case runtime complexity is if the number of hull points
     * is equivalent to the number of points, O(N^2) = O(h^2).
     * 
     * NOTE: one could make an O(N) version of this algorithm assuming h^2 is
     * less than N, by rewriting the bottleneck of the algorithm, the sorting.
     * For the polar angle counter-clockwise sorting of points, one could
     * use counting sort and integer degree bands for the angles.
     * Counting sort runtime complexity is O(max(N, range of data)), so
     * if the range of data were constrained to 0 to 359 for N &gt;= 360,
     * the sort could be done in less than O(N) 
     * and the remaining hull and largest pair algorithm runtime complexity is still O(N).  
     * For the counting sort, if N were less than 360, and O(N) were more appealing than accuracy,
     * the 0 to 359 intervals could be made into a smaller number than 360 of evenly
     * sized bands.
     * TODO: working on that now, and when ready, this algorithm will have a runtime
     * complexity of max(O(N), O(n_hull^2)).

        The implementation below is left as is to show myself that cannot use
        the commonly, possibly mis-interpreted, version of rotating calipers
        that suggests using as a scan range, the furthest point from the mean
        as the start reference point and its furthest point along the hull
        as the end of the scan range and then applying that same range as
        the restricted search range of start points in the next pairs.
        The code below shows that sometimes further than that range
        must be search as first points, and that some pairs of points have
        a larger range of indexes in their own most distant pair.
