/**
 * class to solve for the epipolar and/or essential matrices and their epipoles for two images with stereo projection
 * and apply the solution.
 *
 * the essential matrix contains information about the relative rotation between the 2 cameras and the direction of
 * translation between the two cameras.
 *
 * The fundamental matrix contains information about the relative rotation between the 2 cameras, the direction of
 * translation between the two cameras, and the intrinisc camera matrix.
 *
 * To recover scale one needs to use absolute orientation methods.
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *  The essential matrix is defined by the planes formed by the 3 vectors of optical centers of 2 cameras and the
 *  individual points X in 3D-space called world coordinate system (WCS).
 *  Each point X in 3-D space lies on a plane it forms with the optical centers.
 *  For each of those planes, the point X projected into image 1 is x1 and the point X projected into image 2 is x2.
 *  x1 and x2 can be described by the plane, and also by the rotation and translation between the cameras.
 *  let lambda1 and lambda2 be scale parameters.
 *  lambda1 * x2 = lambda2 * R * x1 + T.
 *
 *  The translation vector is along the baseline between the 2 cameras.
 *  If we pre-multiply both sides by the skew symmetric matrix of T to give us the cross products:
 *     lambda1 * [T]_x * x2 = lambda2 * [T]_x * R * x1 + [T]_x * T
           T cross product with itself is 0.
 *     lambda1 * [T]_x * x2 = lambda2 * [T]_x * R * x1 + [T]_x * T
 *                          = lambda2 * [T]_x * R * x1 + 0
 *         vector T is from epipolar point e1 to epipolar point e2.
 *         vector x2 is from epipolar point e2 to x2.
 *         [T]_x * x2 is perpendicular to x2
 *         so then x2^T * [T]_x * x2 is 0.
 *         we can use that to simplify the equation further when we pre-multiply both sides by x2^T
 *     lambda1 * x2^T * [T]_x * x2 = lambda2 * x2^T * [T]_x * R * x1
 *                0 = lambda2 * x2^T * [T]_x * R * x1
 *
 *     The essential matrix E is defined as [T]_x * R
 *         E = [T]_x * R
 *         x2^T * E * x1 = 0
 *
 *     Epipolar plane is intersection of o1, o2, X where o1 = optical center for camera 1, o2 = same for camera 2.
 *
 *     e1 and e2 are the projections of o1 and o2 into their images (and may exist outside of image bounds).
 *
 *     each point x1, x2 has an epipolar line l1, l2, in its image that is the intersection of x1 with e1, and x2 with e2.
 *
 *     e2^T * E = 0
 *     E * e1 = 0
 *     l2 = E * x1
 *     l1 = E^T * x2
 *     x1^T * l1 = 0
 *     x2^T * l2 = 0
 *
 * The fundamental matrix is the projective solution for transformation
 * between 2 images of the same objects in pixel coordinates.
 *
 *     E = K2^T * F * K1
 *     F = K2^-T * E * K1^-1 where K is the intrinsic camera matrix.
 *       = K2^-T * [T]_x * R * K1^-1  if det(K) ~ 1 else apply a scale factor too.
 *
 *    can also be written
 *      F = K2^-T * E * K1^-1
 *        = ([e_2]_x * K2)  * ([T]_X)^-1 * E * K1^-1
 *        = (K2^-T * [T]_x) * ([T]_X)^-1 * E * K1^-1
 *
 *
 *
 * Present below is the solution for having 7 matched points between images
 * and the solution for having 8 or more matched points between the images.
 * Both use numerical conditioning and recipes suggested by Hartley
 * (see reference below).
 * 
 * For the 8-point algorithm:
 * IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 19,
 * NO. 6, JUNE 1997
 * &quot;In Defense of the Eight-Point Algorithm&quot; by Richard Hartley

 * The 8-point algorithm matrix represents epipolar geometry, and can be
 * used with data from cameras whose characteristics are not known to solve
 * up to the projective transformation.
 * ...a simple transformation (translation and scaling) of the points in 
 * the image before formulating the linear equations leads to an enormous 
 * improvement in the condition of the problem and hence of the stability 
 * of the result...
 *
 * Some definitions:
    vectors are treated as columns unless noted otherwise.
    vector as a row uses notation u^T.
    u^T*v represents the inner product (= dot product).  result is a scalar.
    u*v^T represents the outer product. result is a matrix.
    u_1 is the (x,y) points from image 1 and u_2 are the matched (x,y) points
        from image 2.

     Epipolar Plane:
        An epipolar plane is defined by the principal points o1, and o2 of the cameras and the point p.
     Epipoles:
         The projection of one camera center onto the other camera's image plane is an epipole.
         (the epipole can lie outside the image boundaries)
         in the Essential Matrix: e2 ~ T and e1 ~ R*T up to a scalar factor.
         e1 = right nullspace of FM = SVD(fm).V[*,2].
         e2 = left nullspace of FM = SVD(fm).U[*,2].
         e2^T*E = 0
         E*e1 = 0
     Epipolar line of p:
         intersection of the epipolar place of p with an image place is the epipolar line of p.
         l2 ~ E*x1
         l1 ~ E^T*x2

         l*e=0 for (l1,e1) and also (l2,e2)
         l^T*x=0 for (l1,x1) and also (l2,x2)

    the fundamental matrix is defined:
        u_2^T * F * u_1 = 0  
        where u are the x,y points in images _1 and _2
        and F is a 3 × 3 matrix of rank 2
        
    An explanation of the derivation of the fundamental matrix can be found in
    Zhengyou Zhang. &quot;Determining the Epipolar Geometry and its Uncertainty: A
    Review&quot;. RR-2927, INRIA. 1996. ffinria-00073771
    equations (1) and (2)

        + y_1*F_3_2 + x_2*F_1_3 + y_2*F_2_3 + F_3_3 = 0

    A * f = 0

    where A = x_1*x_2, x_1*y_2, x_1, y_1*x_2, y_1*y_2, y_1, x_2, y_2, 1
             (which is each element of column 0 of u_1 dotted separately with
             row 0 of u2_T)
             A is nData X 9
    and f is a nine-vector (size 9X1) containing the entries of the matrix F
 
    To avoid the trivial scale, ||f|| = 1 where f is the norm of f

    the rank of A is 8, but noise and other errors make it 9.
    if A is longer than 8, the system is over-determined (over specified) and
    so must be solved using least squares.  the set may be over determined
    and not have a zero solution.

    we want the vector f that minimizes ||A*f|| subject to the constraint
    that ||f|| = f^T*f = 1

    the solution is the unit eigenvector corresponding to the smallest
    eigenvalue of A^T*A.

    Since A^T*A is positive semi-definite and symmetric, all of its eigenvectors
    are real and positive or zero.
    This eigenvector is what he calls the least eigenvector of A^T*A and
    it is found via the Jacobi algorithm or Singular Value Decomposition.
    NOTE:
        SVD(A).U == SVD(A^T).V == SVD(AA^T).U == SVD(AA^T).V
        SVD(A).V == SVD(A^T).U == SVD(A^TA).V == SVD(A^TA).U

    The solved for matrix will in general not have rank 2 and needs to, so
    further corrections are necessary:
        matrix F is replaced by F' that minimizes the Frobenius norm
        ||F - F'|| subject to the condition det F' = 0.
        A convenient method of doing this is to use the Singular Value
        Decomposition (SVD).
           let F = U*D*V^T be the SVD of F, where D is diagonal matrix
           D = diag(r, s, t) satisfying r &gt;= s &gt;= t.
           let F' = U*diag(r, s, 0)*V^T.

 (1) Transforming the coordinates:

     Normalization for isotropic scaling.
     1) The points are translated so that their centroid is at
        the origin.
     2) The points are then scaled so that the average distance
        from the origin is equal to 2 .
     3) This transformation is applied to each of the two images independently.

     NOTE: if needed to use non-isotropic scaling (e.g. rectangular pixels, etc):
     transform the points so that
     1) Their centroid is at the origin.
     2) The principal moments are both equal to unity
      
     
     scaling the coordinate so that the homogeneous coordinates are on the 
     average equal to unity will improve the condition of the matrix A^T*A.
     I talso allows use of error calculations such as Sampson's.

 (2) build matrix A with the normalized x,y points

 (3) compute linear least square solution to the least eigenvector of f:
     solve A = U * D * V^T   for A*f = [..x...]*f = 0
     A has rank 8.  F has rank 2.
     calculate [U,D,V] from svd(A)

 (4) make the fundamental matrix have a rank of 2
     by performing a svd and then reconstructing with the two largest
     singular values (similar to dimensionality reduction)
         [U,D,V] = svd(F,0);
         F = U * diag([D(1,1) D(2,2) 0]) * V^T;

 (5) denormalize the fundamental matrix
     The related part of the normalization equation: inv(T_2) * F * inv(T_1)
     so denormalizing is:

         F = (T_2)^T * F * T_1

 (6) estimate the error in the fundamental matrix by calculating epipolar
     lines for points in image 1 and find their nearest points in image 2
     and measure the perpendicular distance from the epipolar line for
     those nearest points.
     NOTE: This is best done using normalized coordinates and fundamental matrix,
     after step (4) and before step (5).

For the 7-point algorithm:
references are:
  the the Hartley &amp; Zisserman matlab code vgg_F_from_7pts_2img
from a version of http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/hzbook/code/ which is part
of the supplementary material for their book &quot;Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision
Second Edition&quot;
   and Hartley, R. I. (1994a). Projective reconstruction and invariants from 
multiple images. PAMI, 16(10):1036–1041
   and Torr, P. H. S. and Murray, D. (1997). 
&quot;The development and comparison of robust meth- ods for estimating the 
fundamental matrix. International Journal of Computer Vision&quot;, 24(3):271–300.

 The 7-point algorithm solves for the null space of the fundamental
 matrix and results in one or 3 solutions which can for some geometries
 be reduced to a single solution.
 The nullspace is where Ax=0 in reduced echelon, that is, the free variable rows.
 The normalization and denormalization steps before and following the solution,
 are the same as in the 8-point solution.

 this from comments in the Hartley &amp; Zisserman matlab code vgg_F_from_7pts_2img:
   Solutions for the 7-points are pruned by requirement that
   scalars s in all equations s * cross(e1,u_1) == F*u_2 are positive.
   In case of multiple solutions, F has one dimension
   more such that F(:,:,n) is the n-th solution.

  note:
    because translation is not a linear transformation (see Strang Chap 7)
       one has to keep it as a separate transformation matrix when
       performing operations on a sequence of matrices such as inverse
       and transpose operations.

    translation matrix: inverse changes the signs of the translation elements,
        but not the diagonal

    rotation matrix: inverse is the transpose of rotation matrix.
     
    scaling matrix: inverse is performed on each element, that is, the reciprocal.

    (A*B*C)^-1 = (C^-1) * (B^-1) * (A^-1)

    also, when A * A^(-1) = I, one can use:
                    1
        A^(-1) =  ------ C^(T)  where C_ij = cofactor of a_ij
                   det A

    for example, comparing results of the 7-point and 8-point 
    solutions or comparing 7-point projection to 6-point affine, etc.

    (1) Transform the coordinates using unit normal standaridization.

    (2) build matrix A with the normalized x,y points.
    (3) The homogeneous system AX = 0 : X is the null space of matrix A.
        The system is nullable because rank 7 &lt; number of columns, 9.

        The nullable system must have a solution other than trivial where
        |A| = 0.

        There should be 9-7=2 linearly independent vectors u1, u2, ... , un-r
        that span the null space of A.

        The right null space of A reduced by SVD is then 2D and the last
        2 columns of V can be extracted and reshaped to [3x3] as F1 and F2.

        A linear convex combination of F1 and F2 form the estimate of F.

        F = α*F1 + (1 − α)*F2  where α is between 0 and 1

        The eigenvalues of F are possible only if the determinant of F is 0.
        The determinant of F is a polynomial function, the characteristic
        polynomial whose degree is the order of the matrix, which is 3 in this
        case. Therefore, the answer(s) to determinant(F) = 0 requires the cubic
        roots of the equation.

        det A = 0 ==&gt; det(α*F1 + (1 − α)*F2) = 0

        because det(F1 + F2) != det(F1) + det(F2), have to step through the
        determinant of the sums, and group the terms by a^3, a^2, a^1, and a^0
        and then solve for the cubic roots as the values of 'a'.

   The matrices multiplied and summed:

    a*ff1[0][0] + (1-a)*ff2[0][0]   a*ff1[0][1] + (1-a)*ff2[0][1]   a*ff1[0][2] + (1-a)*ff2[0][2]
    a*ff1[1][0] + (1-a)*ff2[1][0]   a*ff1[1][1] + (1-a)*ff2[1][1]   a*ff1[1][2] + (1-a)*ff2[1][2]
    a*ff1[2][0] + (1-a)*ff2[2][0]   a*ff1[2][1] + (1-a)*ff2[2][1]   a*ff1[2][2] + (1-a)*ff2[2][2]

    The terms are further grouped below in methods
       calculateCubicRoot...OrderCoefficientFor7Point(ff1, ff2)

    After the cubic root(s) are solved, they are back substituted into :
        Fi = a(i) * FF{1} + (1-a(i)) * FF{2};
    to get the solutions Fi which may be one or 3 solutions.

    * The cheirality of a point is whether it lies in front of or behind a given
    * camera.  It's used to  distinguish between four different possible scene
    * reconstructions from two views.
    * A transform is cheirality-reversing for a given point if it swaps the
    * point from the front to the back of the camera, or vice-versa.
    * Otherwise it is called cheirality-preserving.
    * 
    * note: alternate spelling is chirality.
