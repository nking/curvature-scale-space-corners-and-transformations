<div class="block">class to solve for the epipoles for two images with stereo projection
 and apply the solution.

 <pre>
 The fundamental matrix is the projective solution for transformation
 between 2 images of the same objects in pixel coordinates.
 Present below is the solution for having 7 matched points between images
 and the solution for having 8 or more matched points between the images.
 Both use numerical conditioning and recipes suggested by Hartley
 (see reference below).
 
 For the 8-point algorithm:
 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 19,
 NO. 6, JUNE 1997
 "In Defense of the Eight-Point Algorithm" by Richard Hartley

 The 8-point algorithm matrix represents epipolar geometry, and can be
 used with data from cameras whose characteristics are not known to solve
 up to the projective transformation.
 ...a simple transformation (translation and scaling) of the points in 
 the image before formulating the linear equations leads to an enormous 
 improvement in the condition of the problem and hence of the stability 
 of the result...

 Some definitions:
    vectors are treated as columns unless noted otherwise.
    vector as a row uses notation u^T.
    u^T*v represents the inner product (= dot product).  result is a scalar.
    u*v^T represents the outer product. result is a matrix.
    u_1 is the (x,y) points from image 1 and u_2 are the matched (x,y) points
        from image 2.

     Epipolar Plane:
        An epipolar plane is defined by the principal points o1, and o2 of the cameras and the point p.
     Epipoles:
         The projection of one camera center onto the other camera's image plane is an epipole.
         (the epipole can lie outside the image boundaries)
         in the Essential Matrix: e2 ~ T and e1 ~ R*T up to a scalar factor.
         e1 = right nullspace of FM = SVD(fm).V[*,2].
         e2 = left nullspace of FM = SVD(fm).U[*,2].
         e2^T*E = 0
         E*e1 = 0
     Epipolar line of p:
         intersection of the epipolar place of p with an image place is the epipolar line of p.
         l2 ~ E*x1
         l1 ~ E^T*x2

         l*e=0 for (l1,e1) and also (l2,e2)
         l^T*x=0 for (l1,x1) and also (l2,x2)

    the fundamental matrix is defined:
        u_2^T * F * u_1 = 0  
        where u are the x,y points in images _1 and _2
        and F is a 3 × 3 matrix of rank 2
        
    An explanation of the derivation of the fundamental matrix can be found in
    Zhengyou Zhang. "Determining the Epipolar Geometry and its Uncertainty: A
    Review". RR-2927, INRIA. 1996. ffinria-00073771
    equations (1) and (2) 
    
    u_1 = (x_1, y_1, 1)^T
    u_2 = (x_2, y_2, 1)^T
     
    u_1   = x_1_i    x_1_i+1  ...    
            y_1_i    y_1_i+1  ...
            1        1        ...
 
    u_2^T = x_2_i    y_2_i    1
            x_2_i+1  y_2_i+1  1
            ...      ...      ...

    x_1*x_2*F_1_1 + x_1*y_2*F_2_1 + x_1*F_3_1 + y_1*x_2*F_1_2 + y_1*y_2*F_2_2
        + y_1*F_3_2 + x_2*F_1_3 + y_2*F_2_3 + F_3_3 = 0

    A * f = 0

    where A = x_1*x_2, x_1*y_2, x_1, y_1*x_2, y_1*y_2, y_1, x_2, y_2, 1
             (which is each element of column 0 of u_1 dotted separately with
             row 0 of u2_T)
             A is nData X 9
    and f is a nine-vector (size 9X1) containing the entries of the matrix F
 
    To avoid the trivial scale, ||f|| = 1 where f is the norm of f

    the rank of A is 8, but noise and other errors make it 9.
    if A is longer than 8, the system is over-determined (over specified) and
    so must be solved using least squares.  the set may be over determined
    and not have a zero solution.

    we want the vector f that minimizes ||A*f|| subject to the constraint
    that ||f|| = f^T*f = 1

    the solution is the unit eigenvector corresponding to the smallest
    eigenvalue of A^T*A.

    Since A^T*A is positive semi-definite and symmetric, all of its eigenvectors
    are real and positive or zero.
    This eigenvector is what he calls the least eigenvector of A^T*A and
    it is found via the Jacobi algorithm or Singular Value Decomposition.
    NOTE:
        SVD(A).U == SVD(A^T).V == SVD(AA^T).U == SVD(AA^T).V
        SVD(A).V == SVD(A^T).U == SVD(A^TA).V == SVD(A^TA).U

    The solved for matrix will in general not have rank 2 and needs to, so
    further corrections are necessary:
        matrix F is replaced by F' that minimizes the Frobenius norm
        ||F - F'|| subject to the condition det F' = 0.
        A convenient method of doing this is to use the Singular Value
        Decomposition (SVD).
           let F = U*D*V^T be the SVD of F, where D is diagonal matrix
           D = diag(r, s, t) satisfying r >= s >= t.
           let F' = U*diag(r, s, 0)*V^T.

 (1) Transforming the coordinates:

     Normalization for isotropic scaling.
     1) The points are translated so that their centroid is at
        the origin.
     2) The points are then scaled so that the average distance
        from the origin is equal to 2 .
     3) This transformation is applied to each of the two images independently.

     NOTE: if needed to use non-isotropic scaling (e.g. rectangular pixels, etc):
     transform the points so that
     1) Their centroid is at the origin.
     2) The principal moments are both equal to unity
      
     
     scaling the coordinate so that the homogeneous coordinates are on the 
     average equal to unity will improve the condition of the matrix A^T*A.
     I talso allows use of error calculations such as Sampson's.

 (2) build matrix A with the normalized x,y points

 (3) compute linear least square solution to the least eigenvector of f:
     solve A = U * D * V^T   for A*f = [..x...]*f = 0
     A has rank 8.  F has rank 2.
     calculate [U,D,V] from svd(A)

 (4) make the fundamental matrix have a rank of 2
     by performing a svd and then reconstructing with the two largest
     singular values (similar to dimensionality reduction)
         [U,D,V] = svd(F,0);
         F = U * diag([D(1,1) D(2,2) 0]) * V^T;

 (5) denormalize the fundamental matrix
     The related part of the normalization equation: inv(T_2) * F * inv(T_1)
     so denormalizing is:

         F = (T_2)^T * F * T_1

 (6) estimate the error in the fundamental matrix by calculating epipolar
     lines for points in image 1 and find their nearest points in image 2
     and measure the perpendicular distance from the epipolar line for
     those nearest points.
     NOTE: This is best done using normalized coordinates and fundamental matrix,
     after step (4) and before step (5).

For the 7-point algorithm:
references are:
  the the Hartley & Zisserman matlab code vgg_F_from_7pts_2img
from a version of http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/hzbook/code/ which is part
of the supplementary material for their book "Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision
Second Edition"
   and Hartley, R. I. (1994a). Projective reconstruction and invariants from 
multiple images. PAMI, 16(10):1036–1041
   and Torr, P. H. S. and Murray, D. (1997). 
"The development and comparison of robust meth- ods for estimating the 
fundamental matrix. International Journal of Computer Vision", 24(3):271–300.

 The 7-point algorithm solves for the null space of the fundamental
 matrix and results in one or 3 solutions which can for some geometries
 be reduced to a single solution.
 The nullspace is where Ax=0 in reduced echelon, that is, the free variable rows.
 The normalization and denormalization steps before and following the solution,
 are the same as in the 8-point solution.

 this from comments in the Hartley & Zisserman matlab code vgg_F_from_7pts_2img:
   Solutions for the 7-points are pruned by requirement that
   scalars s in all equations s * cross(e1,u_1) == F*u_2 are positive.
   In case of multiple solutions, F has one dimension
   more such that F(:,:,n) is the n-th solution.

  note:
    because translation is not a linear transformation (see Strang Chap 7)
       one has to keep it as a separate transformation matrix when
       performing operations on a sequence of matrices such as inverse
       and transpose operations.

    translation matrix: inverse changes the signs of the translation elements,
        but not the diagonal

    rotation matrix: inverse is the transpose of rotation matrix.
     
    scaling matrix: inverse is performed on each element, that is, the reciprocal.

    (A*B*C)^-1 = (C^-1) * (B^-1) * (A^-1)

    also, when A * A^(-1) = I, one can use:
                    1
        A^(-1) =  ------ C^(T)  where C_ij = cofactor of a_ij
                   det A

  NOTE: the normalization suggested by Hartley is explored further in
  Chojnacki et al. 2003,  "Revisiting Hartley’s Normalized Eight-Point Algorithm"

    The plunder-dl scoring can be used for comparison between different models.
    for example, comparing results of the 7-point and 8-point 
    solutions or comparing 7-point projection to 6-point affine, etc.

    plunder-dl is from equation 33 of
    Torr, Zisserman, & Maybank 1996, 
    “Robust Detection of Degenerate Configurations whilst Estimating 
    the Fundamental Matrix"
    https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst/Papers/CVIU97/m.ps.gz
     EQN 33: PL = DOF + (4*n_o + n_i dimension of model)
                   where n_i = number of inliers
                   n_o = number of outliers
                   DOF = 7 for this solver
    n=7               PL = DOF + 4*n_o + n_i* (model_dimension)
         ni=7, no=0   PL = 7   + 0     + 0 * md
         ni=5, no=2   PL = 7   + 8     + 8 * md
         ni=4, no=3   PL = 7   + 12    + 28 * md
    PLUNDER stands for Pick Least UNDEgenerate Randomly, Description Length

    For nPoints=8, model_dimension = 1.
    for nPoints=7 amd only 1 solution in the cubic constraints, model_dimension=2,
    else for nPoints=7, model_dimension = 3.

 A summary of epipolar geometry is in chapter 5 of 
 Ma, Soatto, Kosecká, and Sastry 2012, "An Invitation to 3-D Vision".
 
    e2 when normalized by 3rd coord is in coord space of left image and
       it is the location of the right camera center.
    e2 is the last column of svd.u
    e2 is the left nullspace of F
    (e2^T*F = 0  e2^T*E = 0)
      ==> e2~T  where T is translation and ~ is equality up to a scale factor

    e1 is the last row of svd.vt
    e1 is the right nullspace of F
    (F*e1 = 0  E*e1 = 0)
      ==> e1~R^T*T  where R is rotation and T is translation
    l2 = E*x1

    More on the subject is present in "Cheirality in Epipolar Geometry" by
    Werner & Pajdla, 2000 regarding realizability of two images.

    Very clear paper on cheirality:
 http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hartley/Papers/cheiral/revision/cheiral.pdf
 The cheirality of a point is whether it lies in front of or behind a given
 camera.  It's used to  distinguish between four different possible scene
 reconstructions from two views.
 A transform is cheirality-reversing for a given point if it swaps the
 point from the front to the back of the camera, or vice-versa.
 Otherwise it is called cheirality-preserving.
 
 note: alternate spelling is chirality.</div>
